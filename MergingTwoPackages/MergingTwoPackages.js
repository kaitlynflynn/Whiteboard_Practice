// Given a package with a weight limit limit and an array arr of item weights, implement a function getIndicesOfItemWeights that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function should return a pair [i, j] of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty array.

// Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution.

// Example:

// input: arr = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16]
//        limit = 21
// output: [3, 1]   // since these are the indices of 
//                  // weights 6 and 15 whose sum equals 21

// PROBLEM: Write a function that will take a string as an input, returning whether or not the string is a Palindrome.

// PRO TIP - GOOD QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR INTERVIEWER BEFORE YOU START WRITING IT OUT: 
//          1. What type of return do you want to come out of this function? 
//          2. If it's a Palindrome, do you want me to return a boolean that would 
//             return True or False based on whether the word is a Palindrome?

// EXTRA CONTEXT on Native Data Types in JavaScript:
// Interviewers will ask you this type of question to assess your knowledge of Native Data Types. 
// A string is one of the native data types in JavaScript.
// The native data type on string does not have a method to do a reverse of the string, but an array 
// which is a type of an object in JS does have a built in method called reverse that you can use.
// To show you have knowledge of all the primitive data types within JS and how you can move between 
// them to be able to accomplish what you want in this function.
// Now you need to figure out how you can get your string and convert it into an array.
// The string method natively has a method on it that's called split - a split will convert a string 
// into an array so this will be your first step in writing your function below.
